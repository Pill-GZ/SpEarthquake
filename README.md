# SpEarthquake
This is the repo for Biostat 696 project on modelling earthquakes with spatial point process

## Goals

Applying techniques in spatial statistics to the analysis of Seismic activity data to

1. Jointly estimate the number of events, and the magnitude of earthquakes over space.
2. Enable the calculation of probability of earthquake larger than given magnitude within selected distance.
3. Create an interactive tool to implement the calculation

## Approaches

1. parametric estimation
2. non-parametric: kernel estimation

## Co-variates

1. plate tectonics: distance to plate boundaries
2. fracking: distance to fracking sites
